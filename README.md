# Topic
____________
We will develop a website that users can provide feedback on food that is available at the Cornell Campus Center (CC). People can comment on how food specifically was in terms of taste and what could be added. This website won’t replace the current CC menu website but can be used as an extension/plugin by the actual menu website.

# Motivation
____________
Our motivation for selecting this as our project was to improve the quality of the current CC food menu. We also thought it would be essential for students to provide feedback about the food and advocate for themselves so they feel heard and increase the reputation of the cafeteria and quality of the food. We also wanted the online presence of the CC’s menu to be more accurate and readable. The availability of websites related to the Rollins campus is essential to provide students with up-to-date information. It’s also essential that websites or software associated with school should be easy to use. It’s also important that students feel represented on campus. Authenticity in food from different cultures is also important for representation. Finally, we wanted to give back to the Rollins community by building a system using the skills we gained here at Rollins.  


# Primary Objective
_____________
This system will serve to provide more students with being able to see how good the quality of food is at the Cornell Campus Center. It will provide a better indication of how good the food at the CC is and gauge what you should eat based on other people's feedback. 

# Scope
_____________

Our overall goal is to create a website to help with the accuracy of the food in the dining hall at Rollins College. To begin, we will send out a survey to loyal dining hall users to see if they will use this website and benefit from it. The website can be accessed online from any device or browser, such as Safari, Google Chrome, etc. Faculty and students can use the website at any time of the day within proximity of Rollins College using an IP address. The website will have three different tabs or pages for the three different meal times: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The data for the website will stay on for 24 hours from 12:00 A.M. to 11:59 P.M. Each page will consist of the meal name (breakfast, lunch, or dinner), a table of contents that scrolls to a different section on the website, the meals, and a feedback section. Users will have the ability to leave feedback on specific food items, they also have the ability to view the feedback and filter the feedback based on food food. The target market for our system is Rollins students, faculty, and staff who frequent the dining hall. To gauge interest in our system, we will send out surveys to groups of Rollins students, Faculty, and staff who use the dining hall to track if and how much they will use the website. As a strategy to promote our website, we will make posts about the website on our social media and put up flyers with a QR code linking to our website all around campus.
